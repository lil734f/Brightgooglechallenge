# Brightgooglechallenge

This repo contains the code to part 1 of the Google software engineering challenge that was required as part of the Bright Internship Experience: Technology 2021. I am extremely grateful to have been a part of this experience and for all the things that I learnt.

I only added part 1 as I ran out of time and wanted to submit a stable version of the code (not an edited part 2 version that does not work), the original repo can be found here: https://github.com/internship-experience-uk/google-code-sample.

For reference, the document that refers to the parts to complete as part of the challenge is called coding-challenge_instuctions.pdf.
